# You can assume that paths() is called with an integer as first
# argument, an integer at least equal to 1 as second argument,
# and integers between 0 and 9 as third and fourth arguments.

# A path connects numbers to numbers by moving South,
# South West or South East.

# Note that <BLANKLINE> is not output by the program, but
# doctest's way to refer to an empty line
# (here, output by the print() statement in the stub).
